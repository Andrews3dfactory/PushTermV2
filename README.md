- More reliable automation
- Fully rewritten backend
- Launch the **new & improved OG Terminal** too

*(Yes… partly because my SD card slot is broken 😅)*

### 💸 Cost
**100% FREE — forever**
- No paid features
- No locked tools

### ⏳ Status
In development — updates coming soon

### ❤️ Support
Donations will be added soon if you want to support the project 🙌

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ Fast & lightweight  
- 🖥️ Terminal-based control  
- 🧩 Custom workflows  
- 🖨️ Built for print automation  
- 🔧 Easy to modify (Python)  
- 🌐 Web-connected printer control  

---

## 📦 Installation

PushTerm is available on PyPI:

```bash
pip install pushterm
```

Or download the **Zip file** (recommended for latest version).

---

## 🧪 How to Use

1. **Download or clone** this project folder.  
   Place your G-code file (e.g., `Ploter.gcode`) inside the `MyPrints` folder.

2. Run the launcher from the terminal:

```bash
python launcher.py
```

3. In the terminal:
   - Type: `cd MyPrints`
   - Then: `begin`
   - Enter your file name (e.g., `Ploter.gcode`)
   - Set the delay:
     - `m5` → 5 minutes
     - `s30` → 30 seconds
   - Confirm how many copies to eject

4. The modified file will be saved in the same folder as the original file with the name:

```
yourPrintFileName_modified.gcode
```

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Edits G-code automatically  
- Adds delay after prints  
- Pushes finished prints off the bed  
- Keeps safe nozzle height

---

## ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.x installed  
- No extra dependencies — just basic Python and a terminal

---

## 📂 Structure
**Updated Strucure coming soon when the new program is fully done**
```
PushTerm/
├── launcher.py
├── terminal_ui.py
├── MyPrints/
└── README.md
```

---

## 🚨 Notes

- Test G-code before real use  
- Works best on flat beds  
- Optimized for Bambu Lab (adaptable)

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Because your printer should finish a job and immediately start the next one like a machine 😤
